# Therapy Finder App

The idea of the app is that it allows you to take tests that assess if you are likely to be diagnosed with a variety of mental disorders. It then tells you at the end of these tests which ones you likely could be diagnosed with and what therapy treatment methods would likely work for them. So say you are screened to be likely to have ocd it tells you you should seek out a therapist trained in ERP, exposure response prevention therapy, since it is the most effective known therapy for ocd. Then it constructs a link for you to psychtoday using a system I created to automatically create the right link to show you therapists near you with that training.

Alternatively, you could also submit your diagnoses and it will tell you what therapies should work best for them and show you local therapists trained in these therapies.
