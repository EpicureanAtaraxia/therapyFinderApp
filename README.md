# Therapy Finder App

The idea of the app is that it allows you to take tests that assess if you are likely to be diagnosed with a variety of mental disorders. It then tells you at the end of these tests which ones you likely could be diagnosed with and what therapy treatment methods would likely work for them. So say you are screened to be likely to have ocd it tells you you should seek out a therapist trained in ERP, exposure response prevention therapy, since it is the most effective known therapy for ocd. Then it constructs a link for you to Psychtoday using a system I created to automatically create the right link to show you therapists near you with that training. Alternatively, you can also directly plug in a variety of mental health diagnoses to skip having to take the assessments.

# Why Create This?

I made this app because I thought there was often a lack of knowledge in the general public regarding what sort of training you should look for in a therapist when trying to find one that fits your specific needs. So, I hope this app helps some people in this regard and gives them some easy guidance. I did this by telling them at the end what therapies are proven in the scientific literature to help with their likely diagnoses. Then I send them a link showing them therapists near them who are certified as being able to conduct these types of therapies.

I originally came up with the idea for this app because starting in high school I was diagnosed with OCD. I didn't know what type of therapist to look for, so I went to a lot of therapists who would see me but had no proper training in how to treat OCD. It wasn't till much later I discovered the different therapy training people can get certified in and which one was the best for ocd according to the academic literature. After I figured that out and went to someone with proper training it helped out tremendously. I thought I'd make the app to help people with the same issue I had, mainly finding a qualified therapist for one's specific needs. My brother, who is a licensed therapist, helped out tremendously in doing the research needed to make this app!

# How Can I Use This App? See The Flutterflow Branch!

Once I have it more polished I hope to publish it on Google Play and the App Store. For now, you can use it by going to the flutterflow branch and downloading the Therapy Finder App-release.zip file. You then want to open it and download the .apk file. You can run this on an Android phone or an Android simulator.
